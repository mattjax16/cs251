        class priors (i.e. how likely an email is in the training set to be spam or ham?) and the
        class likelihoods (the probability of a word appearing in each class â€” spam or ham)

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data: ndarray. shape=(num_samps, num_features). Data to learn / train on.
        y: ndarray. shape=(num_samps,). Corresponding class of each data sample.

        TODO:
        - Compute the instance variables self.class_priors and self.class_likelihoods needed for
        Bayes Rule. See equations in notebook.

        '''Combine the class likelihoods and priors to compute the posterior distribution. The
        predicted class for a test sample from `data` is the class that yields the highest posterior
        probability.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data: ndarray. shape=(num_test_samps, num_features). Data to predict the class of
            Need not be the data used to train the network

        Returns:
        -----------
        ndarray of nonnegative ints. shape=(num_samps,). Predicted class of each test data sample.

        TODO:
        - Process test samples one-by-one.
        - For each, we want to compute the log of the numerator of the posterior:
        - (a) Use matrix-vector multiplication (or the dot product) with the log of the likelihoods
          and the test sample (transposed, but no logarithm taken)
        - (b) Add to it the log of the priors
        - Predict the class of each test sample according to the class that produces the largest
        log(posterior) probability (use argmax)

        Parameters:

            Ground-truth, known class labels for each data sample
